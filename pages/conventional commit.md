- # Commit types
- forked from https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type
-
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- ~~ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)~~ I think this can be expressed by `fix(ci)` or `perf(ci)` etc.
- docs: Documentation only changes
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- ui: User Interface improvement
- refactor: A code rewrite that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- improve: Similar to `refactor`, but doesn't emphasize a huge amount of "rewrite".
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc). This is for those changes made by formatter or linter.
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
